# Progressive Muscle Relaxation with NAO Robot H25 v6

About
Progressive Muscle Relaxation is a simple muscle relaxation exercise to help reduce stress and align people with their inner mindfulness. This exercise is ideal for employees who feels pressured or stressed at work. It can be conducted in a room in a short session together or alone with the assistance of NAO robot. NAO Robot acts as the trainer for the exercise by helping the participants to move their body parts one by one and slowly. NAO supports this exercise by playing calming sound in the background.

How the program works
After a short introduction, the participants are asked to follow NAO movement of a body part.
After each of 1 body part exercise, NAO asks to participants if they can follow the movements. NAO listens to participants' yes or no answer. If participants says yes, then this body part exercise is completed. Otherwise NAO gives command to repeat the movements together once more.
